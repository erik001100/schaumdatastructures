Schaum's Outlines - Data Structures With Java - Implement Answers in Python
===========================================================================

This is my personal project to review Hubbard's "Data Structures With Java" 
book and re-implement the answers in Python.

Why?
====

Everyone needs to review their data structures every couple of years. I 
have the book and figured it would be a great exercise. Also, the book 
is not expensive; it is a Schaum's Outline. The ISBN is 0-07-136128-6

How?
====

Many of the exercises are the run of the mill CS exercises used in problem 
sets. I will progress a chapter at a time.
